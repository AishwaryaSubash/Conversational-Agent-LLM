A team of 26 enthusiastic students from the Department took the initiative to set up this chapter. The official launch was on 22nd September 2011.

As one of the well-known institutions inside the college, we aim to bolster student skills from both a professional and personal point of view by organising events like Hackathons, workshops and quizzes. As we set foot into our seventh successful year, we aim to maintain the high standards set by our predecessors by organising events intertwined with fun and frolic, for we believe in: \"Simplicity, carried to the extreme, becomes elegance\".\n","        Organizing technical events intertwined with loads of fun filled challenges is our forte. Our wide variety of events boosts both 'competing by learning' as well as 'learning by competing'!

It was officially chartered by ACM New York on 26th August 2011. ACM is an international organization whose aim is \"Advancing computing as a science and profession\". A team of 26 enthusiastic students from the Department took the initiative to set up this chapter. The official launch was on 22nd September 2011. SVCE ACM student chapter was set up to facilitate all activities which aim at spreading quality computing education by setting up learning groups, organizing seminars, conducting workshops, facilitating contests and so on.\n","\n","    ACM-SVCE STUDENTS CHAPTER\n","        The SVCE ACM student chapter aims to provide an opportunity for students from different walks of life to compete and tackle problems in an effective manner. As one of the well-known institutions inside the college, we aim to bolster student skills from both a professional and personal point of view by organising events like Hackathons, workshops and quizzes. As we set foot into our seventh successful year, we aim to maintain the high standards set by our predecessors by organising events intertwined with fun and frolic, for we believe in: \"Simplicity, carried to the extreme, becomes elegance\".\n","        Organizing technical events intertwined with loads of fun filled challenges is our forte. Our wide variety of events boosts both 'competing by learning' as well as 'learning by competing'!

A team of 26 enthusiastic students from the Department took the initiative to set up this chapter. The official launch was on 22nd September 2011.

As one of the well-known institutions inside the college, we aim to bolster student skills from both a professional and personal point of view by organising events like Hackathons, workshops and quizzes. As we set foot into our seventh successful year, we aim to maintain the high standards set by our predecessors by organising events intertwined with fun and frolic, for we believe in: \"Simplicity, carried to the extreme, becomes elegance\".\\n        Organizing technical events intertwined with loads of fun filled challenges is our forte. Our wide variety of events boosts both \\'competing by learning\\' as well as \\'learning by competing\\'!
